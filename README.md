## Business Recommendation

To drawn insight as to which of the products customers would most likely purchase, we would need to focused mainly on the income of the customers and the usage each product received after purchase. We focused on this data as it helps us explain to Company who its products reached the most and also who its product affected the most. TM195 is sought the most and used the least, and TM798 is sought the least but itâ€™s the most used treadmill. With this information, Company management could either sell more of TM798 or get TM195 to be more frequently used. TM195 also has one key advantage over TM498 as there were about 20% of its user, opposed to 13% of TM498 who ran more than 107 miles, which is the bottom half of the majority TM798 users ran. This means that 20% of those who purchased TM195 utilized it as if it were a TM498.

Finally, to change what product the company wants to sell / increase profitability, the company management would need to decide if they want to sell low priced goods which may lead to more profit or if they would rather focus on the higher end products which the customers used the most. If option 2 is chosen, proven fitness result of the high end products is a marketable output that the Company management can be to convince new buyers.
